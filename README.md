## üîí Security Notes

## 1. ‚ö†Ô∏è The MERN version currently uses a local MongoDB instance.
=> This means all saved passwords are stored together without user accounts.
=> If used by multiple people, their passwords could mix together.
=> It should not be used in production without authentication and user separation.

## 2. The LocalStorage version is only for demonstration purposes.
=> Data is stored in the browser‚Äôs local storage.
=> Clearing browser cache will delete all saved passwords.

## ‚ú® Future Improvements

1. Add user authentication (JWT / OAuth)
2. Implement password encryption before saving in DB
3. Deploy using MongoDB Atlas + Vercel/Render
4. Separate user data to avoid conflicts
